How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because it points out the differences between two versions of code and thus
enables to spot the only possible lines where the bug could have appeared.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It can help to load any previous version of the code at any time and thus
monitor the improvements brought by any programmer

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: What you commit is a functionnal version of the code (vs automatic
save which can save a non funcionnal version of a code), you can manage to 
track the changes with the description added to a commit,

Cons: you have to do it manually, and be rigourous in order not to forgot/skip
a save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because it is manageable to commit multiple files at once while Google docs 
for example manages individually each file and to find a modification that
has affected several files is a bit tedious.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log: all the commits made and thus enables to track the differences 
brought by one specific commit
By using git diff between a specific commit and the previous one we can observe
the differences effectively made in the code for this specific commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    we can easily navigate to previous functional versions of the code thanks to
checkout and thus find the bug, and easily come back to the current version
and correct it as long as we have the ID of the commits
